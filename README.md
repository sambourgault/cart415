this repo holds sam's attempts to dive into game design.

## Jan 31th, 2018: Touch up before adding sound and gathering them

Prototype 1: High highway --> I removed the second highway to simplify the visual.

Prototype 4: Infinite zoom --> As you zoom in, the inner tank is surrounded by more and more cacti.

Prototype 5: Enter the void --> In this world of tanks, tanks are either alone in their house turning around in circle or having sex. This is a pretty binary world but tanks know nothing else.

Prototype 6: Mother --> No significant change.

Prototype 7: God --> I increased the amount of tanks, so that God gets more followers.

Now I must add an ambient sound to replace the horrible music that is starting to get me crazy, I might reuse it but distort it a lot. I also need some sounds for specific moments: when the tanks turn toward their god, for the vibrating tank, and for the baby tanks drinking milk from their mother tank.

## Jan 30th, 2018: New versions

Other ideas came up while I was biking the other day. Moving my legs in circle activates my brain in a strange but recurrent way.

Prototype 6: You are the camera attached to the eyes of each tank in the scene (8). You jump from one perspective to the other but you remain confused by what you see since the framing doesn't tell much about your surrounding. When you finally look at the scene from the main camera's perspective, you realized that you are attending a scene where tank babies are drinking their tank mother milk. The camera's perspective becomes the only way to fully understand what is going on.

Prototype 7: You are the camera and you look at dozens of tanks. The tanks keep facing you because you are their god, their leader, and they need you. In this prototype de camera becomes the main points of attention. The passive and active roles are inverted.

*A question remains, how to connect the prototypes together in a comprehensive/coherent way??*
One option is to present the game as a series of spiritual quests for the tanks.

## Jan 22th, 2018: Still brainstroming for ideas

I ended up pushing further Prototype 1 (Traffic) and Prototype 4 (Volte-Face).

Prototype 1: You are a camera located on a tanks highway but you are stuck in traffic. Your ability to pierce the most solid carcass with your sight lets you see inside the tanks that are moving slowly towards an end. This prototype strives to discover the humanity within the metal frame of the destroying machine. It could be pushed further by adding conversation between the pilots of the tanks.

Prototype 2: You play a casual shooting game, but when you die your tank soul leaves your tank body and starts moving around.

Prototype 3: You are a tank and you try to find tank buddies to play with you, but every tank is busy.

Prototype 4: You are the camera and you zoom inside the tank’s barrel. You discover the inner side of the tank, with all its vulnerability. There is a close relationship between the camera and the gun since they have shared similar features in their early developments. This affiliation explains the use of the expression “shooting” to describe the operation of both tools. So what happens if the camera is shooting the tank’s turret? Is it history revolving? This prototype is an infinite zoom through the tank past, present and future.

Prototype 5: You are a camera and you move through walls in order to see the tank intimacy, what are they doing when human are not playing the TANKS! game?

## Jan 21th, 2018: Ideas for first prototypes

**Ideas**

*CAMERA*
- photo montage like La Jetee.
- small variations between cuts, in the position of objects
- no background erasing
- people inside the tanks and camera inside
- camera filming the front of the tanks
- low angle shot from the trunk of the tanks
- play with zoom in or zooming out
- camera rotates along z-axis and gravity changes with it. (inception style)
- going from one room to the other with the camera (enter the void).. maybe the players is just entering the intimacy of the tanks, where they live, in their apartments, while getting a shower, etc.. and the camera is always moving horizontally and vertically.
- limitless zoom, or zooming out (from pixel to infinity) (limitless)
- vertigo effect (vertigo)
- transparencies, layers on top of each other

*LIGHT*
- shadows moving if light moves in branches for example
- silhouette of the tanks from afar
- stage lighting
- black and white

*OTHER*
- answering questions
- simplification of the game (cube for tank)
- long corridors in space
- tank is alone in the world, in a world but there are highways full of tanks going in one direction that don’t want to play with you. traffic of tanks.
- instructions to the tanks
- dancing tanks


## Jan 12th, 2018: First intervention

I just submit a first intervention for TANKS!, in which instead of shooting at each other, the tanks are thanking each other. Starting with a casual "thank you!", they start arguing about who is thanking whom. In the end, the tanks are fighting again, with words this time.

It reminds me of Jean-Paul Sartre's scenario "L'Engrenage" or Albert Camus's play "Les Justes", which both discuss an authoritarian political climate that revolutionaries try to change by force. But once in power, they end up reproducing the same patterns that they were fighting against not long ago.

I developed it quickly thinking, first, that I would replace the shells, because i have no interest in war/shooting games and, second, that the pun on "tanks" and "thanks" was funny enough to exploit.


## Jan 9th, 2018 : First thoughts on TANKS!

- the yellow color of the desert is now flooding my screen. everything is working except the dust trails that resemble more to a grandpa coughing than anything else.
- i suck at driving a tank. i can figure out why i never got my license.
- i am a videogame looser. i prefer wandering around.

**On TANKS!**

*General comments on current state*
- the map feels too big for me, i wish it was more intimate. it feels dry, not because of the desert context.
- the only light is a directional light acting as a sun.
- the camera is orthographic and it changes size and zoom according to the tanks relative position.
- why do tanks want to kill each other?
- why can you get more than one life?

*General comments on future states*

What if..
- the map consisted in little platforms separated from each other. movements would be irrelevant.
- the lights were stroboscopic like in a night club.
- the tanks would exchange words instead of shell (sooo diplomatic).
- the tanks would film each other in a voyeuristic way.
- the tanks would shoot seeds and create a garden.
- the tanks would get their period once a month, and that would suck so much.
- the game was called THANKS!.
- their would be plenty of false tanks (false as simulation), so you would win if you kill the right one.
- maybe there won't be a right one.
