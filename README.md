## Jan 21th, 2018: Ideas for first prototypes

** Ideas **

*CAMERA*
- photo montage like La Jetee.
- small variations between cuts, in the position of objects
- no background erasing
- people inside the tanks and camera inside
- camera filming the front of the tanks
- low angle shot from the trunk of the tanks
- play with zoom in or zooming out
- camera rotates along z-axis and gravity changes with it. (inception style)
- going from one room to the other with the camera (enter the void).. maybe the players is just entering the intimacy of the tanks, where they live, in their apartments, while getting a shower, etc.. and the camera is always moving horizontally and vertically.
- limitless zoom, or zooming out (from pixel to infinity) (limitless)
- vertigo effect (vertigo)
- transparencies, layers on top of each other

*LIGHT*
- shadows moving if light moves in branches for example
- silhouette of the tanks from afar
- stage lighting
- black and white

*OTHER*
- answering questions
- simplification of the game (cube for tank)
- long corridors in space
- tank is alone in the world, in a world but there are highways full of tanks going in one direction that donâ€™t want to play with you. traffic of tanks.
- instructions to the tanks
- dancing tanks


## Jan 12th, 2018: First intervention

I just submit a first intervention for TANKS!, in which instead of shooting at each other, the tanks are thanking each other. Starting with a casual "thank you!", they start arguing about who is thanking whom. In the end, the tanks are fighting again, with words this time.

It reminds me of Jean-Paul Sartre's scenario "L'Engrenage" or Albert Camus's play "Les Justes", which both discuss an authoritarian political climate that revolutionaries try to change by force. But once in power, they end up reproducing the same patterns that they were fighting against not long ago.

I developed it quickly thinking, first, that I would replace the shells, because i have no interest in war/shooting games and, second, that the pun on "tanks" and "thanks" was funny enough to exploit.


## Jan 9th, 2018 : First thoughts on TANKS!

- the yellow color of the desert is now flooding my screen. everything is working except the dust trails that resemble more to a grandpa coughing than anything else.
- i suck at driving a tank. i can figure out why i never got my license.
- i am a videogame looser. i prefer wandering around.

**On TANKS!**

*General comments on current state*
- the map feels too big for me, i wish it was more intimate. it feels dry, not because of the desert context.
- the only light is a directional light acting as a sun.
- the camera is orthographic and it changes size and zoom according to the tanks relative position.
- why do tanks want to kill each other?
- why can you get more than one life?

*General comments on future states*

What if..
- the map consisted in little platforms separated from each other. movements would be irrelevant.
- the lights were stroboscopic like in a night club.
- the tanks would exchange words instead of shell (sooo diplomatic).
- the tanks would film each other in a voyeuristic way.
- the tanks would shoot seeds and create a garden.
- the tanks would get their period once a month, and that would suck so much.
- the game was called THANKS!.
- their would be plenty of false tanks (false as simulation), so you would win if you kill the right one.
- maybe there won't be a right one.
